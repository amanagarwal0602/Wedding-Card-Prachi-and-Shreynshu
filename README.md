# Prachi ❤ Shreyanshu — Wedding Website

A single-page, scrollable wedding website built with semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and a dash of vanilla JS. Includes countdown and sections for Couple, Events, Venue, and FAQ.

## How to run

- Windows: Double-click `weeding.html` to open in your default browser.
- Or open the folder in VS Code and use the Live Preview/Live Server extension for best results.

## Customize

Edit `weeding.html` and update:
- Names, dates, and venue in the Hero section.
- Couple bios (photos removed by request).
- Event details and times.
- Venue details and the Google Maps link.

Colors, fonts, and layout variables live in `styles.css` under the `:root` section.

## Notes

- All images previously used were placeholders—gallery and RSVP sections have been removed.
- The site is print-friendly and mobile-responsive.
